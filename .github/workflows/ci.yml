    steps:
      # 1. Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up the Bun runtime
      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
        with:
          bun-version: latest # Use the latest version of Bun

      # 3. Installs dependencies (equivalent to 'bun install')
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

      # 4. Runs the build command (equivalent to 'bun build')
      - name: Build project
        run: bun build
        
      # 5. (Optional) If you have a lint command, add it here
      # - name: Run linter
      #   run: bun lint 
      #   (You'll need to add a "lint" script to your package.json first)
